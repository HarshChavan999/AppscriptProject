# **Course Payment Data Insertion Error - FIX**

## **The Issues Found:**

### 1. **Frontend Error Handling Missing**
- Frontend had success handler but no failure handler
- When backend returned error, user saw "saved successfully" even when it failed
- **Fix:** Added `.withFailureHandler()` to show actual error messages

### 2. **Incorrect Sheet Name**
- Code tried to open `"FeeStructure"` (capital S) 
- But actual sheet name was `"Feestructure"` (lowercase s)
- **Fix:** Changed sheet name in `saveCoursePayment()` function

## **Current Status:**
- ✅ Both fixes applied
- ✅ Error handling now shows proper messages  
- ✅ Sheet name corrected
- ✅ Changes deployed to Google Apps Script

## **Test the Fix:**
Try submitting a course payment again. Now you'll see:
- Success message: "Course payment saved successfully!"
- Error message: Actual error details if something fails
